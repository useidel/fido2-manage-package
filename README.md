# fido2-manage-package

This repo maintains a RPM SPEC file for [fido2-manage](https://github.com/token2/fido2-manage) to manage FIDO2.1 devices over USB or NFC.

With this RPM SPEC file and facilitating the build plattform [Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/) as well as [OBS](https://build.opensuse.org/)
I can easily create source and binary packages and make them accessible for YUM/DNF/ZYPPER.
